This Shiny App is written in R and has an interactive map that adjusts the table as countries are clicked on within the frame after zoom. The table is from a list of labs created by the global community and continuously updated with a list of laboratories that can host Ukrainian scientists at all career levels.

This application is currently live at [ShinyApps.io]([https://mikelly11.shinyapps.io/UkraineScientists/])
