## GlyCombo
![Screenshot](/images/GlyCombo.png)
GlyCombo is an open source software for combinatorial glycan composition determination to identify glycans in MS acquisitions of glycan-containing samples in text or mzML formats. This application enables rapid extraction of precursor m/z values from mzML files, a vendor-neutral format that ensures cross-platform compatibility.
